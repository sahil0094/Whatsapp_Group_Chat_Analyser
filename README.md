# Whatsapp_Group_Chat_Analyser
The project started with the idea to apply the skills gained in text analytics to something we use in our daily life.

### Approach-
I exported whatsapp group chat of our official college groups since every conversation in that group is purely in English.
I was able to extract great insights into some of the students as well as the mentors like who is the most active, what time
the group is most active and who sends the longest texts and many more. 
Mainly regex was used to extract different pattern texts and translate group chat into dataframe.
Extensive usage of seaborn and matplotlib to visually show the pattern and insights found
